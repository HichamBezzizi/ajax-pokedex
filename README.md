# Ajax Pokédex

![PokéDex](./assets/img/ajaxpokedex.png)

This is a Pokédex that I had to make with a co-learner during my education at BeCode.

## Mission

- Learn about Ajax.
- Learn about JSON and the JSON format.
- Learn about DOM manipulation.
- Learning how to read the documentation of an API.

## How does the app work

1. You can search a pokémon by name.
1. It will display the searched pokémon and its previous evolution
1. It will display the pokémon's ID, Name and 4 of its moves.
1. If there is no previous evolution of the searched pokémon, then it will display an image of a question mark.

## What did I learn from this

1. What is an API
1. Fetching data from an API
1. Using DOM manipulation to display the data into my front-end.

## What was the most challenging

Figuring out how to display the data at first was the most challenging and learning about the concept of promises.

# Revamped pokédex

I remade the pokédex with cleaner code. I have also separated my Fetch and my DOM logic and used Async/Await.
